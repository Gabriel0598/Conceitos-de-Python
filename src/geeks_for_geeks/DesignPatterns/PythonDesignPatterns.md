# Python Design Patterns Tutorial
[GeeksForGeeks Tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-design-patterns/>)

Design patterns in Python are communicating objects and classes that are customized to solve a general design problem in a particular context. Software design patterns are general, reusable solutions to common problems that arise during the design and development of software. They represent best practices for solving certain types of problems and provide a way for developers to communicate about effective design solutions.

## What are Design Patterns?

A design pattern is a generic repeatable solution to a frequently occurring problem in software design that is used in software engineering. It isnâ€™t a complete design that can be written in code right away. It is a description or model for problem-solving that may be applied in a variety of contexts.

2. Structural Design Patterns
   1. Adapter Method
   2. Bridge Method
   3. Composite Method
   4. Decorator Method
   5. Facade Method
   6. Proxy Method
   7. Flyweight Method
3. Behavioral Design Patterns
   1. Command
   2. Observer 
   3. Mediator
